 My computer experience comes mostly from my past 4 years at school. Before coming to New Paltz for my undergrad degree in computer science, I took a year of computer classes at community college. I have also done some game programming from a class in high school, and on my off time I like to work with mechanics. I’ve taken allot of classes like object oriented programming, all the CS1-3 classes, digital logic to provide some deeper knowledge, and a class dedicated to learning different programs and how to use them.

 This is a class I can see becoming a crucial chunk of information I will use in the future. As an aspiring game developer, learning menu display and development will help, as well being able to create a published page that can receive documents, pictures, or inputs of any kind and record, store, or manipulate that info as needed.

I am very aware of how the computer ‘thinks’ and how we need to input our information so we can get the desired output with minimal computation. As I have not really used html much in the past, I am prepared to learn what is necessary.
